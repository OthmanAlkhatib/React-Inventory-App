# Inventory - Simple React App

## Description
Inventory is a simple React web application designed as a learning project to explore the basics of React.js. The app displays a table with data retrieved from a db.json file using npm json-server, providing a practical demonstration of React's fundamental concepts and functionalities.

## Features
- Display Data in a Table: Inventory presents the stored data in a user-friendly table format, making it easy to view the relevant information.
- Add and Delete Items: Users can add new items to the inventory and delete existing ones, offering an interactive experience in managing the data.
- Filtering Data: The app supports filtering data based on various aspects, enabling users to quickly find the specific information they need.

## Technologies Used
- React.js: The frontend framework used to build the user interface and manage the components' dynamic behavior.
- json-server: A lightweight mock REST API server used to store and manage the data in the db.json file.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Start the json-server to serve the data by running "json-server --watch db.json" in the project directory.
4. Launch the React app with "npm start" or "yarn start."
5. Interact with the inventory table, add new items, delete existing ones, and try out the filtering feature.

## Learning Objectives
- Getting familiar with React.js concepts such as components, state, and props.
- Understanding how to fetch and display data from a mock API using json-server.
- Implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities in a React app.
